# StayKing

StayKing is a simplified staking dApp, used for staking KING tokens, that aims to replicate the core logic of staking, in hopes that aspiriing builders can understand how staking works in high-level.

It consists of the two main essential logic when it comes to staking which is stake tokens and unstakes token function.

Note: You can use this as a starting point in understanding how staking works, and with the core logic functions laid out, there are definite improvements you can make.
